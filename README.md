# Applied-Machine-Learning
This repository is consist of five method of machine learning with different dataset.
1. Association Rules
This is the first method that can be used for market basket analysis with apriori algorithm. The dataset of this method is using a data from astra data scientist bootcamp participant when they buy a product in ecommerce. The goals of this method is to make the best market basket that can be used for making the best combination of an item.
Dataset : Untitled Form.csv

2. Collaborative Filtering
This method is used to make a movie recommendation of a new user input based on the data of movie review in the new user community. The result of this method is also a recommendation user to watching the movie together that have the same ratings with the new user. The dataset of this method is using a data from astra data scientist bootcamp participant survey. 
Dataset : Movies.csv and Ratings.csv

3. Content Based Filtering
This method is used to make a movie recommendation of a new user input based of the dataset of movie rating that can be defined with a genres of the movie. The dataset of this method is using a data from astra data scientist bootcamp participant survey. 
Dataset : Movie.csv and Ratings.csv

4. Hybrid Recommender System
This method is a combination of Collaborative Filtering and Conten Based Filtering. In this Hybrid method is using Content based filtering first to find the movie recommendation of a new user input based of the dataset of movie rating that can be defined with a genres of the movie. Then it used Collaborative Filtering to make  a recommendation user to watching the movie together that have the same ratings with the new user. 
Dataset : Movie.csv and Ratings.csv

5. A/B Testing
This method is used to make a comparation beetween two condition in dataset. Then in this dataset, the goals is to finding the best design for landing page of ecommerce with the condition old and new design.
Dataset : ab_data
